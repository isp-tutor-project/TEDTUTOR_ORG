    <ol>
    <li class="ref_List">The results of two studies comparing student transfer outcomes from TED to a lesson from a local school district's science curriculum. We also discuss results of prompting students to think more about the problems caused by confounded variables on their learning and transfer performance.

    <li class="ref_List">Conceptual understanding of why controlling variables is necessary predicts students' ability to transfer their knowledge of CVS.

    <li class="ref_List">Lower-knowledge students--or students who were confused about the purpose of the experimental-design activity--benefited from a warm-up activity prior to a CVS lesson in TED. In contrast, higher-knowledge--or students who understood the purpose of the activity as designing experiments to find out about a particular variable--benefited more from spending this time engaged in instructional activities in TED.

    <li class="ref_List">We have identified several common misconceptions among students learning about experimental design. For example, some students--especially younger students and students from lower-SES (socio-economic status) populations--misinterpret the instruction as about discussing the effect of the variables or as setting up the conditions to produce a particular effect or what they consider to be the "best" outcome. Students generally appear to learn how to design good experiments incrementally, or one rule at a time, rather than "all at once."

    <li class="ref_List">The best way to frame instruction on CVS depends on student characteristics. We found that non-standard framings (e.g. as "solving brain teasers" vs. the traditional framing as "designing science experiments") may be particularly beneficial for younger (e.g., fifth-grade) and lower-SES (socioeconomic status) student populations. However, older students and students with more inquiry-related knowledge benefited most from the traditional "science experiment" framing.

    </li>

    <li class="ref_List">Although "concrete" details of example experiments (e.g., the type of surface of a ramp) may distract some student from the purpose of the activity, this information may also support students' understanding of why controlling variables is necessary. In this study, we varied the concreteness of example experiments used during instruction, from abstract experiments described in terms of "variables" that were "the same" or "different" across conditions to more concrete experiments that contained real variables (e.g., a "rough" or "smooth surface"). Students generally learned more from the more concrete versions of the experiments.
